<!-- ![RNN for Cardiovascular Disease Detection](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/images/cardiovascular_disease_detection.png) -->

The RNN for Cardiovascular Disease Detection project is an innovative application of deep learning techniques to detect and predict cardiovascular diseases using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Built using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, this project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for early detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.

## Key Features

- Cardiovascular Disease Detection: The project utilizes a trained RNN model to analyze patient data and accurately predict the presence of cardiovascular diseases.
- Efficient Data Processing: The application processes large datasets efficiently, handling complex input features related to patients' medical history, lifestyle, and other relevant factors.
- Deep Learning with RNNs: RNN models are employed to capture temporal dependencies in the patient data, allowing for more accurate predictions based on sequential patterns.
- Model Training and Evaluation: The project includes scripts for training the RNN model using labeled data and evaluating its performance through various metrics and validation techniques.
- Real-time Predictions: Once trained, the model can be deployed to make real-time predictions on new patient data, enabling early detection and timely interventions.
- User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface to input patient data, visualize predictions, and interpret the results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install <package>
   ```

3. Prepare and preprocess the dataset:

   - Gather patient data, ensuring it includes relevant features for cardiovascular disease detection.
   - Preprocess the data, handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

4. Train the RNN model:

   - Use the provided training script and the preprocessed dataset to train the RNN model.
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters, network architectures, and optimization techniques to achieve the best performance.

5. Evaluate the model:

   - Evaluate the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Perform cross-validation or holdout validation to assess the model's generalization capability.

6. Deploy and make predictions:

   - Deploy the trained model to make real-time predictions on new patient data.
   - Utilize the user-friendly interface to input patient data, visualize predictions, and interpret the results.
